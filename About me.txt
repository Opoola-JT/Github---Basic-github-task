My Name is Opoola Joshua Toluwanimi, and I am a solution. 
I am the fastest being the flash could nbever be, because i exist and I'm real
Everything I touch turns to Gold. I am the Ire Ayo Song by Adekunle Gold
The Life i am searcging ffor is looking me right in the eye
I am mnore than meet the eye, and i velive in myself die.
I like myself. I choose myself, I am choosen for something bigger than self
And I EXCEL. This what I choose to belive, This is my opinion of me. 
This is who you get to meet when you meet me
